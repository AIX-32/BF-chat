# Party System Testing Instructions

## Fixes Applied

1. **Enhanced Authentication Validation**
   - Added proper `puter.auth.isSignedIn()` checks
   - Fresh user data retrieval for each operation
   - Better error handling for authentication failures

2. **Party State Management**
   - Added `isCreatingParty` and `isInParty` flags to prevent duplicate operations
   - Only one party creation at a time
   - Users must leave party before creating/joining another

3. **Comprehensive Console Logging**
   - Added detailed console.log statements throughout
   - Logs every step of party creation, joining, and data operations
   - Easy to debug what's happening in the browser console

4. **Debug Mode**
   - Set `DEBUG_MODE = true` to skip hosting for faster testing
   - Focuses on KV store and file storage only
   - Much faster for same-user testing

5. **Better Error Handling**
   - More descriptive error messages
   - Graceful fallbacks when storage methods fail
   - Proper cleanup on errors

6. **UI State Management**
   - Better handling of fullscreen mode exit
   - Proper state reset when leaving parties
   - Improved party verification

## How to Test

### Quick Testing (Recommended)
1. Set `DEBUG_MODE = true` in the code (line ~473)
2. Optionally set a fixed party ID for testing: `partyId = "DEBUG1"` (line ~509)
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Watch console logs for detailed debugging info

### Step-by-Step Testing
1. **Sign In**: Click "Sign In to Start"
2. **Create Party**: Click "Create Party" 
   - Watch console for party creation steps
   - Note the generated party code
3. **Test Same-User Access**: Refresh page, sign in, join with same code
4. **Test Messages**: Send messages and watch real-time updates

### Debugging Tips
- Always keep browser console open (F12 → Console)
- Look for error messages in red
- Check for authentication issues first
- Verify party data is being stored with console logs

### Expected Console Output
```
Testing KV store...
Test data stored
Test data retrieved: {...}
Test cleanup complete
Starting party creation...
Generated party ID: ABC123
Party data created: {...}
Writing party data to storage...
Party ABC123 stored as direct file
Party ABC123 stored in KV store
Party ABC123 stored successfully via at least one method
```

### Common Issues Fixed
- ❌ "Create Party does nothing" → ✅ Now logs each step and shows errors
- ❌ Authentication issues → ✅ Better auth validation and fresh user data
- ❌ Multiple party creation → ✅ State management prevents duplicates
- ❌ Cross-user delays → ✅ Debug mode for faster same-user testing
- ❌ Silent failures → ✅ Comprehensive error logging and user feedback

### For Cross-User Testing
1. Set `DEBUG_MODE = false`
2. Create party on Account A
3. Wait 30-60 seconds for hosting to propagate
4. Join from Account B using the party code

The system now provides much better feedback about what's happening at each step!
